# Note: This yaml file serves as an example for overriding the manifest
# to enable additional externally managed Ceph Cinder backend. When additional
# externally managed Ceph Cinder backend is provisioned as shown in
# cinder/values_overrides/external-ceph-backend.yaml of repo openstack-helm,
# below override is needed to store the secret key of the cinder user in
# libvirt.
